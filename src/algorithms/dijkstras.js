/**
 * Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm
 * The optimal algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph.
 * • Requires that all the path weights are positive.
 * • Greedy algorithm - the unvisited vertex w/ lowest weight path is always the one visited next
 * made using: http://courses.washington.edu/css502/zander/Notes/05graphsDijkstra.pdf
 * @param nodes 2d array of nodes, a node has .row, .col, .isStart, .isFinish, .isVisited
